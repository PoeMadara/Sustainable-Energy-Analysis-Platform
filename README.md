## Project Overview

The **Sustainable Energy Analysis Platform (SEAP)** is my final project from the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack. The project focuses on predicting **renewable energy generation trends** for solar, wind, hydroelectric, and biofuel sources. By leveraging **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, the goal is to assess energy efficiency and demand during the transition to clean energy sources.


### **Key Models**:
- 游늭 **Multi-Output Random Forest for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Optimized with Grid Search** (MO-RF-MTSF-GS).
- 游늭 **Recurrent Neural Network with Multilayer Perceptron for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting** (RNN-MLP-MTSF).

## Objectives
-  Predict future energy production trends for renewable sources.
-  Analyze energy demand and efficiency in clean energy transitions.
-  Provide **interactive visualizations** for data exploration and predictions.
-  Develop advanced AI models for **real-time** energy insights.

---

##  Technologies Used
This project leverages a variety of tools:
-  **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data processing.
-  **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** for visualizations.
-  **Scikit-Learn** for Machine Learning models.
-  **TensorFlow/Keras** for Deep Learning.
-  **Geopandas** and **Folium** for spatial data analysis.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository and set up the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f ml-dp.yml
   conda activate ml-dp
   ```

2. Download necessary folders: `data` and `shapefiles`.

3. Open and run the notebooks:
   - `SEAP_01_EDA_map_and_cleaning.ipynb`
   - `SEAP_02_Machine_Learning_and_Deep_Learning.ipynb`

4. Generated models and maps will be saved in the `final_models` and `maps` folders.

## Some Visualizations (Check out the notebooks for more!)

- **Global Renewable Energy Trends**:

  > The graph shows a significant increase in renewable electricity production, with solar and wind energy growing over time, while hydroelectric power remains dominant. It also shows an exponential increase in electricity demand since 2000, making renewable energy sources currently insufficient to fully replace non-renewable energy.

  
- **Energy Demand vs. Supply**:

## Future Directions

Looking ahead, my goal is to develop an **AI system** capable of managing larger datasets through **Deep Learning** techniques. This AI will provide **real-time predictions** and enable **interactive communication**, allowing users to explore energy-related challenges and propose sustainable solutions.
